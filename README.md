# LongestCommonPrefix
I wrote a function in Python to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. The Strings are coded in the function also If there is no common prefix, it will return an empty string "". This is a common easy interview question for software programs so feel free to leave issues or questions and play around with the code
